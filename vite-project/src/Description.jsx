      <h2>Performance-Based Appraisal System (PBAS)</h2>
      <p>
        The Performance-Based Appraisal System (PBAS) is a structured evaluation framework designed to assess faculty performance based on various academic, research, and administrative parameters. It ensures fair, transparent, and data-driven performance evaluation, helping institutions make informed decisions regarding promotions, career advancements, and workload management.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        PBAS categorizes faculty contributions into multiple areas, including teaching, research, professional development, administrative responsibilities, and extracurricular activities. Faculty members are required to document their achievements and submit them through the PBAS portal for review by the institution's evaluation committee.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This system automates the appraisal process, reduces paperwork, and enhances efficiency, ensuring that faculty members receive appropriate recognition for their contributions. Additionally, PBAS supports continuous improvement by providing feedback and encouraging faculty to engage in professional development.
